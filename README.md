# PlayifyDownloader

This Chrome extension allows downloading from a few video sites.

## Helper Program

For better support, go to[NativeMessaging](https://github.com/Playify/PlayifyDownloader_NativeMessaging), and download the exe file inside `_run`.
With this, you can just click the `FFmpeg` Button, and it automatically opens a new cmd window
for that, without needing to paste the command manually.
